26) Co-function identity: sin(θ) = cos(90° − θ).
27) 180° = π radians) This is the conversion factor.
28) π/3 radians = 60°) Multiply by 180/π to convert.
29) y = sin(x) is a smooth, periodic wave between −1 and 1.

33) cos(2x) = cos²(x) − sin²(x) or equivalent forms.
34) Reference angle is the acute angle from the x-axis.
35) cot(0°) is undefined because tan(0°) = 0 and 1/0 is undefined.
36) sec(0°) = 1 since cos(0°) = 1.
37) csc(90°) = 1 since sin(90°) = 1.
38) D in the equation causes vertical shift.
39) B affects the period: period = 2π / B.
40) Amplitude is 4) The negative sign reflects the graph.
41) sin(x) = ½ at 30° and 150° on the unit circle.
42) arcsin(1) = 90°, the angle whose sine is 1.
43) arccos(0) = 90°, since cos(90°) = 0.

45) Phase shift = C / B.
46) Period = 2π / 3 for y = 5sin(3x).
47) Max value = A + D, since sine peaks at 1.
48) Min value = -A + D, since sine drops to -1.
49) D is the vertical shift; it moves the graph up or down.
50) A negative amplitude reflects the graph across the x-axis.
